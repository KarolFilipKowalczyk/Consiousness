## Abstract

This work presents a unified computational theory of consciousness that integrates insights from Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Attention Schema Theory (AST), and quantum consciousness approaches within a novel framework based on **non-uniform finite machine hierarchies**.

**Core Innovation:** Consciousness emerges from the collapse of parallel computational explorations across a hierarchy of finite-state machines with exponentially growing resources (M₁, M₂, M₃, ..., Mₙ where Mₙ has 2ⁿ bits of memory). The hierarchy exhibits a **generalized non-uniform structure** where effective levels follow `M_n ⊆ M_{n+f(n)}` with variable resource gaps `f(n) ≥ 1`, representing realistic cognitive resource allocation.

**Key Insight:** While real computational time includes all parallel attempts, backtracks, and time-reversals, subjective conscious experience perceives only the successful computational path—a smooth, continuous temporal flow that never experiences the failed branches.

## Key Contributions

### 1. **Non-Uniform Machine Hierarchy**
- Replaces linear inclusion `M_n ⊂ M_{n+1}` with generalized `M_n ⊆ M_{n+f(n)}`
- Variable gap function `f(n) ≥ 1` explains:
  - **Small gaps** (f ≈ 1-2): Incremental, analytical processing
  - **Large gaps** (f ≫ 1): Gestalt insights, "aha!" moments
- Universality condition: `lim(n→∞) f(n) = ∞` ensures asymptotic universality

### 2. **Temporal Collapse Mechanism**
- Distinguishes **computational time** (includes all explorations) from **subjective time** (collapsed path only)
- Explains temporal phenomenology: why consciousness feels unified and forward-flowing
- Connects to memory consolidation: failed attempts never enter accessible memory

### 3. **Resolution of Hard Problem**
- Consciousness IS collapsed computation experienced from within
- No explanatory gap: the computational structure itself is necessarily experiential
- Dissolves dualism through identity, not production relation

### 4. **Non-Computable Selector**
- Resource allocation follows non-computable optimization (related to Kolmogorov complexity)
- Provides natural account of agency and free will
- Genuine top-down causation without violating physical law

### 5. **Integration of Existing Theories**
- **IIT**: Integration within each machine level (Φ > Φ_min required)
- **GWT**: Global workspace = post-collapse broadcasting mechanism
- **AST**: Attention schema = selector's internal model
- **Quantum theories**: Classical collapse with similar phenomenology

## Mathematical Framework

### Core Definitions

**Machine Hierarchy:**
```
M_n ⊆ M_{n+f(n)} where f: ℕ → ℕ⁺, f(n) ≥ 1
Resource: R_n = 2^n bits
Universality: lim(n→∞) f(n) = ∞
```

**Realistic Cognitive Levels:**
```
M₁₅: 32K bits    - Basic perception
M₂₀: 1M bits     - Object recognition  
M₂₅: 32M bits    - Working memory
M₃₀: 1G bits     - Complex reasoning
M₃₅: 32G bits    - Peak consciousness
```

**Temporal Integration:**
```
τ_n ≈ 2^n · τ₀ where τ₀ ≈ 50ms
Integration window grows exponentially with level
```

**Collapse Function:**
```
Π: X_n(T) → P_n
Maps exploration space to phenomenal state
Irreversible: information loss creates arrow of time
```

## Key Theorems

1. **Asymptotic Universality**: For any computable function f, ∃n such that M_n can compute f on all inputs of interest
2. **Level-wise Decidability**: For each fixed n, all properties of M_n are decidable
3. **Strict Hierarchy**: ∀n, ∃ problems solvable by M_{n+f(n)} but not by M_n
4. **Selector Non-Computability**: No computable function always returns minimal n for problem solution
5. **Agency from Non-Computability**: System exhibits genuine agency that resists algorithmic capture

## Testable Predictions

### Neural Signatures
1. Discrete capacity levels at M₁₅, M₂₀, M₂₅, M₃₀ (not smooth gradation)
2. Event-related potentials show variable-latency components
3. Resource transitions correlate with increased neural synchrony
4. Different tasks activate different gap patterns

### Behavioral Predictions
1. Working memory shows discrete jumps, not smooth scaling
2. Reaction times cluster at level transitions
3. Individual differences in gap patterns predict cognitive style
4. Time estimation varies with resource jump magnitude

### Clinical Implications
1. Disorders involve hierarchy disruption or collapse failure
2. Attention deficits reflect selector malfunction
3. Altered states show abnormal gap dynamics
