## Main Paper: Consciousness as Collapsed Computational Time

**Length:** 236 pages  
**Entry point:** `main.tex`  
**PDF:** Available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17556941)

### Abstract

This work presents a unified computational theory of consciousness that integrates insights from Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Attention Schema Theory (AST), and quantum consciousness approaches within a novel framework based on **non-uniform finite machine hierarchies**.

**Core Innovation:** Consciousness emerges from the collapse of parallel computational explorations across a hierarchy of finite-state machines with exponentially growing resources (M₁, M₂, M₃, ..., Mₙ where Mₙ has 2ⁿ bits of memory). The hierarchy exhibits a **generalized non-uniform structure** where effective levels follow `M_n ⊆ M_{n+f(n)}` with variable resource gaps `f(n) ≥ 1`, representing realistic cognitive resource allocation.

**Key Insight:** While real computational time includes all parallel attempts, backtracks, and time-reversals, subjective conscious experience perceives only the successful computational path—a smooth, continuous temporal flow that never experiences the failed branches.

## Extended Papers (3papers/)

### 1. Adjoint Projections on Computational Hierarchies

**File:** `3papers/adjoint_projections.tex`

**Abstract:** Develops the categorical structure of hierarchical computation using adjoint functors. Introduces compression/reconstruction as genuine adjunctions with:
- Computable behavioral metrics
- Exact adjunction via linear codes
- Polynomial-time level assignment
- Entropic scaling analysis

**Key Contributions:**
- Formal category-theoretic framework
- Behavioral distance metrics for machine similarity
- Computational complexity bounds
- Connection to consciousness theory via projection operations

### 2. Quantum Measurement as Hierarchical Projection

**File:** `3papers/quantum_measurement.tex`

**Abstract:** Applies the hierarchical framework to quantum measurement, proposing that measurement involves finite-time information processing with entropic scaling.

**Main Predictions:**
1. **Projection delay:** `τ(m) = τ₀ + γ m ln m` (entropic scaling with qubit number)
2. **Born rule corrections:** Deviations at O(1/m) for systems with m qubits

**Novel Aspects:**
- Connects measurement dynamics to computational complexity
- Testable predictions differing from standard QM
- Framework for experimental falsification

**Critical Note:** Highly speculative but rigorously falsifiable. Physical motivation remains unclear but mathematical structure is well-defined.

## Practical Applications (selectors/)

### Sleep-Wake Orchestration in Hierarchical LLM Cohorts

**File:** `selectors/Sleep-Wake Orchestration in Hierarchical LLM Cohorts.tex`

**Abstract:** Applies consciousness theory to practical AI systems. Proposes alternating sleep-wake cycles for LLM ensembles where models periodically withdraw for targeted fine-tuning on "gap regions" not covered by similar-capacity peers.

**Key Features:**
- **Gap-based learning:** Target regions where models fail but higher-level models succeed
- **Resource allocation:** Fixed 1/3 training, 2/3 inference budget
- **Safe deployment:** Canary rollout with automatic rollback
- **Theoretical foundation:** Formal adjunction between sleep (projection) and wake (collapse)
- **Biological inspiration:** Computational analog of sleep-dependent memory consolidation

**System Components:**
1. **Selector:** Routes queries to appropriate model level
2. **Meta-selector:** Monitors performance and triggers escalation
3. **Sleep scheduler:** Manages rotation between active and training states
4. **Gap detector:** Identifies coverage weaknesses in behavioral space

**Theoretical Connections:**
- Implements adjunction: `Pₙ ∘ Cₙ ≈ id` (consolidation preserves information)
- Behavioral distance metrics in shared embedding space
- Convergence guarantees under stationarity assumptions

**Implementation:** Complete Python implementation demonstrates practical feasibility.

## Key Contributions Across Repository

### 1. **Non-Uniform Machine Hierarchy**
- Replaces linear inclusion `M_n ⊂ M_{n+1}` with generalized `M_n ⊆ M_{n+f(n)}`
- Variable gap function `f(n) ≥ 1` explains both incremental processing and insight moments
- Universality condition: `lim(n→∞) f(n) = ∞` ensures asymptotic universality

### 2. **Temporal Collapse Mechanism**
- Distinguishes computational time (all explorations) from subjective time (collapsed path)
- Explains why consciousness feels unified and forward-flowing
- Connects to memory consolidation and sleep functions

### 3. **Resolution of Hard Problem**
- Consciousness IS collapsed computation experienced from within
- No explanatory gap: computational structure is necessarily experiential
- Dissolves dualism through identity rather than production relation

### 4. **Non-Computable Selector**
- Resource allocation follows non-computable optimization
- Natural account of agency and free will
- Top-down causation without violating physical law

### 5. **Integration of Existing Theories**
- **IIT:** Integration within each level (Φ > Φ_min required)
- **GWT:** Global workspace = post-collapse broadcasting
- **AST:** Attention schema = selector's internal model
- **Quantum theories:** Classical collapse with similar phenomenology

### 6. **Practical AI Applications**
- Sleep-wake orchestration for LLM ensembles
- Self-optimizing model ecosystems
- Computational homeostasis in production systems

## Mathematical Framework

### Core Definitions

**Machine Hierarchy with Entropic Scaling:**
```
M_n ⊆ M_{n+f(n)} where f: ℕ → ℕ⁺, f(n) ≥ 1
Information capacity: I(n) = κ n log n bits
Processing time: τ(n) = τ₀ + γ n log n
Universality: lim(n→∞) f(n) = ∞
```

**Realistic Cognitive Levels:**
```
M₁₅: 32K bits    - Basic perception
M₂₀: 1M bits     - Object recognition  
M₂₅: 32M bits    - Working memory
M₃₀: 1G bits     - Complex reasoning
M₃₅: 32G bits    - Peak consciousness
```

**Collapse Function:**
```
Δ : X_n(T) → P_n
Maps exploration space to phenomenal state
Irreversible: information loss creates arrow of time
```

**Adjoint Structure:**
```
C_n ⊣ P_n : L_{n+1} ⇄ L_n
C_n: Collapse (execution, wake phase)
P_n: Projection (learning, sleep phase)
```

---

## Key Theorems

1. **Asymptotic Universality**: For any computable function f, ∃n such that M_n can compute f on all inputs of interest

2. **Level-wise Decidability**: For each fixed n, all properties of M_n are decidable

3. **Strict Hierarchy**: ∀n, ∃ problems solvable by M_{n+f(n)} but not by M_n

4. **Selector Non-Computability**: No computable function always returns minimal n for problem solution

5. **Agency from Non-Computability**: System exhibits genuine agency that resists algorithmic capture

6. **Sleep-Wake Duality**: Sleep (projection) and wake (collapse) form adjunction with P_n ∘ C_n ≈ id

7. **Gap Convergence**: Under stationarity, total gap mass converges to ε with probability 1-δ

## Testable Predictions

### Neural Signatures
1. Discrete capacity levels at M₁₅, M₂₀, M₂₅, M₃₀ (not smooth gradation)
2. Event-related potentials show variable-latency components
3. Resource transitions correlate with increased neural synchrony
4. Different tasks activate different gap patterns

### Behavioral Predictions
1. Working memory shows discrete jumps, not smooth scaling
2. Reaction times cluster at level transitions
3. Individual differences in gap patterns predict cognitive style
4. Time estimation varies with resource jump magnitude

### Quantum Predictions (speculative)
1. Measurement time scales as τ(m) = τ₀ + γ m ln m
2. Born rule corrections at O(1/m) for m qubits
3. Retrocausal signatures in delayed-choice experiments

### AI System Predictions
1. Sleep-wake cycles improve coverage while reducing escalation costs
2. Gap-based training outperforms uniform training
3. Behavioral distance predicts model performance on queries
4. System achieves equilibrium with stable resource allocation
